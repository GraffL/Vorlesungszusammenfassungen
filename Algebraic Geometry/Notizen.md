## Theorems ##

* An equivalent formulation of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is: The field of complex numbers is algebraically closed, i.e. $\bar\IC = \IC$.
	--> Hilbert's Nullstellensatz can be seen as a vast generalization of the FTA (for many polynomials in many variables instead of one polynomial in one variable)



## Remarks/Questions ##

* Alebgraic Complexity Theory is a thing (apparently connected to algebraic geometry)
	--> e.g. complexity of matrix multiplication
	--> there is an algebraic P vs NP
